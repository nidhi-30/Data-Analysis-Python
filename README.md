# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
First preprocessed the data from 1000 csv files. The data can be found in 'data.zip'. On preprocessed data, ANN and CNN has been applied with cross-validation and the code for this is in 'ANN_CNN.ipynb' file. All the files related to this analysis are in 'Deep learning for ER' folder.

# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Feature Extraction
The data used for this in in 'dataset.zip'. In this analysis, image data has been used. First, using CNN features has been extracted and then traditional machine learning algorithms were applied. The code is in 'ANN_RF.ipynb' file. All the files are in 'Feature Extraction Data' folder.

# Chronic Kidney Disease
This analysis contains the data visualization and comparision between the performances of different machine learning algorithms. The data for this is in 'kidney_disease.csv' and code is in 'CKDPredictionCode.ipynb' which can be found in 'Chronic kidney Disease'.

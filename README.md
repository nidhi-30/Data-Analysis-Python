# Data-Analysis-Python

# Chronic Kidney Disease
This analysis contains the data visualization and comparision between the performances of different machine learning algorithms. The data for this is in 'kidney_disease.csv' and code is in 'CKDPredictionCode.ipynb'.

# Deep learning for ER
First preprocessed the data from 1000 csv files. The data can be found in 'data.zip'. On preprocessed data, ANN and CNN has been applied with cross-validation and the code for this is in 'ANN_CNN.ipynb' file.

# Feature Extraction using CNN
The data used for this in in 'dataset.zip'. In this analysis, image data has been used. First, using CNN features has been extracted and then traditional machine learning algorithms were applied. The code is in 'ANN_RF.ipynb' file.

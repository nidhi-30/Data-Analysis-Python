# Chronic Kidney Disease
This analysis contains the data visualization and comparision between the performances of different machine learning algorithms. The data used for the analysis is in 'kidney_disease.csv' and code is in 'CKDPredictionCode.ipynb'. For more detail, please refer to the report in the same folder.

# Deep learning for ER
The data for this optimization problem is in 1000 different excel file which needs to be preprocessed can be found in 'data.zip'. After preprocessing of the data, ANN and CNN has been applied with cross-validation and the code for this is in 'ANN_CNN.ipynb' file.

# Feature Extraction using CNN
This analysis has been done on image data which is in 'dataset.zip'. First, using CNN features has been extracted after data augmentation and then traditional machine learning algorithms were applied. The code is in 'ANN_RF.ipynb' file.
